                <article>
                    <p>I have been a journalist for over 10 years, writing for a lot of different media. I worked
                        for newspapers, radio and television. I learned to write articles and developed other skills
                        such as camera techniques, photography and video editing. Today journalists are required to have
                        a certain technical expertise. I embraced the possibilities and loved learning new skills.</p>
                    <p>Which brings me to my new field. Two years ago I became interested in software development. I
                        enrolled in a few courses and ever since, I've become more interested. Being able to create my
                        own website without Wordpress or Joomla, is thrilling. But the possibilities are endless. I can
                        even create my own app or setup a database.</p>
                    <p>I believe journalism and software development share a lot of similarities. Of course, they are
                        two very different jobs, but they both require some creativity and punctuality.</p>
                    <p>To keep myself balanced, I enjoy jogging and a good film.</p>
